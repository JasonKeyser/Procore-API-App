# Procore-API-App
Connect to the Procore API using OAUTH2, and make API calls to many useful endpoints.




Create a Procore Developer account at https://developers.procore.com/

Follow the instructions to create your own internal app, and receive client id and client secret credentials.
(This process can be a little confusing. I found helpful videos in the Procore API module within the Procore Certifications
section of my companies website. The documentation about the API in the Procore Developer Portal was also useful).

Once you have obtained credentials, you can use these scripts to authenticate with your companies site using OAUTH2 protocal
and make a variety of calls to useful API endpoints.

You can create a sandbox app to test and understand how making calls will work. Note, in order to create
a live app that will interact with your company's Procore site, you will need someone with Admin level permissions
to "turn on" your app in the App Management section of Procore.
